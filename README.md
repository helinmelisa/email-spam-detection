# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning - Project Readme

## Project Overview
Welcome to the "Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning" project! This project aims to guide you through creating a machine-learning model that can effectively detect spam emails. Following the steps outlined in this guide, you'll learn how to preprocess email data, extract relevant features, train a machine learning classifier, and evaluate its performance.

## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this project, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts (especially classification).
- Understanding of data preprocessing techniques.
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- Python virtual environment (virtualenv) installed on your machine.

## Get Started
1. **Clone the Repository:** Start cloning the project repository from the provided GitHub link.
   
 ```
git clone <https://github.com/helinmelisa/email-spam-detection.git>
 ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Change your current working directory to the cloned repository.

```
cd <repository_directory>
 ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

a. For the Node.js part of the project:
- Navigate to the `web_app` directory.
- Run the following command to install the required Node.js dependencies:
  
  ```
  npm install
  ```

b. For the Python part of the project:
- Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.
